# Lambdac - Lambda Calculus in C

Pronounced "lam-dac" not "lambda-c". It's a fucking garbage fire waiting to
happen.

## Why?

Because it's a pain in the dick to figure any of this shit out, so I'm doing it
the hardest fucking way possible!

## What is this really?

I plan on implementing the untyped lambda calculus, and then the **WHOLE FUCKING
LAMBDA CUBE** and I'm going to do it all in C because doing it in Haskell or Coq
would be **SO MUCH FUCKING SIMPLER** but then you don't learn how to represent
the **ABSTRACT AS FUCK** lambda calculus in the **REAL AS FUCKING HELL**
language C where you have to think about **EVERYFUCKING THING** like memory
management and how types are represented in memory (when we get to that).

Maybe I'll document all this and make this a series of blog posts someday.
